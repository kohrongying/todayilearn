# Basic auth
```
Authorization: Basic xxxx
```
The string is a base64 encoded string of `username:password`

- As username and password are passed over as clear text, basic auth scheme is not secure. HTTPS should be used in conjunction.

# Bearer auth (token auth)
```
Authorization: Bearer xxxx
```
The bearer token is a cryptic string, generated by server which can be understood as "give access to bearer of this token".

- Should also be used over HTTPS. Anyone with your token can gain access.
