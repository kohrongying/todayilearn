## Alfred
Got the powerpack courtesy of company license. It. Is. Life. Changing.

Features I love most:
1. clipboard history
2. Alfred workflows (automation)
3. clipboard history

## Creating my own workflow
1. Jira workflow
- "jira" keyword
- conditional block
- if next query is "ps" -> open this link in chromoe
- else if next query is "abc" -> open this link in chrome
- else if next query matches digits (regex) -> open the jira card number in chrome
- else do -> open this link in chrome

2. Epoch to Human Readable workflow
- "epox" keyword
- bash script `date -r {query}`
- output to large type

## Lesson learnt
- Use and import workflow created by others
- Create your own to automate daily tasks or bothersome things you do everyday
