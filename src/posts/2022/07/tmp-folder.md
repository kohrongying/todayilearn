## Temporary folder
It is what it is. Don't store your application scripts or logic here.
For transient files

## /tmp vs /var/tmp
1. If we reboot our system, files in /tmp are deleted but /var/tmp are only deleted by a system reboot
2. /tmp files are deleted after 10 days automatically but /var/tmp deletion happens once a month
